Section 1., paragraph 13:

>    This document focuses solely on CDNI FCI, with a goal to specify a
>    new Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285] service

  Application Layer -> Application-Layer


Section 2.2., paragraph 1:

>    Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) [RFC7285] is an

  Application Layer -> Application-Layer


Section 3.5., paragraph 1:

>    The resource ID of the resource based on which the CDNI FCI map will
>    be defined.  For example, if a CDNI FCI map depends on a network map,
>    the resource ID of the network map MUST be included in "Uses" field.

  Please clarify HOW "a CDNI FCI map depends on a network map" (the
  usage or semantics). You can just mention that "see Section XXX".


Section 3.6., paragraph 1:

>    If a CDNI FCI map does not depend on other resources, the "meta"
>    field of a CDNI FCI map response MUST include the "vtag" field
>    defined in Section 10.3 of [RFC7285], which provides the version tag
>    of the retrieved CDNI FCI map.  If a CDNI FCI map response depends on
>    a resource such a network map, it MUST include the "dependent-vtags"
>    field, whose value is a single-element array to indicate the version

  Why single-element array? Please remove this restrict. And please
  clarify the current defined dependent resource can be only network
  map, the usage is described in the next section.


Section 3.6., paragraph 7:

>    Specifically, a CDNIFCIMapData object is a dictionary map object, and

  dictionary map object -> JSON object


Section 3.6., paragraph 8:

>    it includes only one element whose key is "capabilities" and which

  it includes only one property "capabilities" whose ...


Section 3.6., paragraph 9:

>    value is an array of CDNIFCIobject objects.  The CDNIFCIObject object
>    may also contain an optional list of CDNIFCIFootprint objects.  The

  may also -> MAY. Why "also"? Is there anything before "also"?


Section 3.6., paragraph 10:

>    FCIFootprint object specifies a "footprint-type" (as defined by the
>    CDNI Metadata Footprint Types registry, e.g., ipv4cidr, ipv6cidr,
>    asn, or countrycode [I-D.ietf-cdni-metadata]) which identifies the
>    contents and encoding of the individual footprint entries contained
>    in the associated "footprint-value" array.

  Do we really need such a paragraph? It seems to just repeat the
  same thing as the schema does. Please just describe the semantics
  and refer RFC8006/RFC8008.


Section 3.6., paragraph 11:

>    The "footprints" list MUST NOT contain multiple FCIFootprint objects
>    of the same type.  Footprint restriction information MAY be specified

  You need to define how to handle the repeated types. "MUST NOT"
  is not helpful.


Section 3.6., paragraph 12:

>    using multiple different footprint-types.  If no footprint
>    restriction list is specified (or an empty list is specified), it
>    SHALL be understood that all footprint types MUST be reset to

  SHALL -> MUST. Why "SHALL"? MUST be -> are.


Section 4.1., paragraph 1:

>    The ALTO Protocol offers an information service "ALTO map service"
>    that provides information to ALTO clients in the form of Network Map
>    and Cost Map [RFC7285].  As an alternative to the explicit definition
>    of a CDNI Footprint Type (e.g., ipv4cidr, ipv6cidr, as, countrycode),
>    a reference to an ALTO network map can be used to define an FCI

  Revise this paragraph please. You should not mention the relationship
  between "ALTO map service" and Network Map. What's the relationship
  between ALTO CDNI FCI MAP and Network Map?


Section 4.1., paragraph 3:

>    The first altonetworkmap entry must be a URI for accessing the ALTO
>    server that hosts the ALTO network map (as defined in the ALTO

  "MUST be a resource id of an ALTO Network Map resource". And please
  also revise the corresponding example.


Section 5.6., paragraph 2:

>    The returned CDNI FCI map MUST contain only CDNI FCI objects whose
>    CDNI capability object is the superset of one of CDNI capability
>    object in "cdni-fci-capabilities".  To be more specific, that a CDNI

  "To be more specific" -> "Specifically"


Section 5.6., paragraph 3:

>    capability object A is the superset of another CDNI capability object
>    B means that these two CDNI capability objects have the same
>    capability type and mandatory-to-specify properties in capability
>    value of A MUST include mandatory-to-specify properties in capability

  mandatory-to-specify -> mandatory


Section 5.6., paragraph 4:

>    value of B semantically.  For example, if a CDNI FCI capability in
>    "cdni-fci-capabilities" is Delivery Protocol capability object with
>    "http/1.1" in its field "delivery-protocols" and the original full
>    CDNI FCI map has two CDNI FCI objects whose capabilities are Delivery
>    Protocol capability objects with "http/1.1" and "http/1.1, https/1.1"

  "http/1.1" -> ["http/1.1"] ; "http/1.1, https/1.1" -> ["http/1.1",
  "https/1.1"]


Section 5.6., paragraph 6:

>    The version tag included in the "vtag" field of the response MUST
>    correspond to the unfiltered CDNI FCI map information resource from

  unfiltered -> full ; delete "information"


Section 5.7.1., paragraph 1:

>    This example is filtering on the full CDNI FCI map example in

  delete "on"


Section 6., paragraph 1:

>    In this section, we describe how ALTO clients look up properties for
>    individual footprints.  Our design decision here is to use ALTO
>    unified property map service to query footprint properties because we
>    do not want to introduce extra complexity and ALTO unified property
>    map defined in [I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new] is already met the

  is already met -> already meets


Section 8., paragraph 1:

>    One important security consideration is the proper authentication of
>    advertisement information provided by a downstream CDN.  The ALTO
>    protocol provides a specification for a signature of ALTO information
>    (see 8.2.2. of [RFC7285].  ALTO thus provides a proper means for

  (see Section 8.2.2 of [RFC7285]). means -> mechanism?
