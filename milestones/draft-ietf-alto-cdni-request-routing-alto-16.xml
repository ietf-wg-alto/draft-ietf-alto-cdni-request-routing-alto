      <t>
        The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) framework
        defines a set of protocols to interconnect CDNs, to achieve multiple
        goals such as extending the reach of a given CDN to areas that are
        not covered by that particular CDN. One component that is needed to
        achieve the goal of CDNI described in CDNI framework is the CDNI
        Request Routing Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface
        (FCI). RFC 8008 defines precisely the semantics of FCI and provides
        guidelines on the FCI protocol, but the exact protocol is explicitly
        outside the scope of that document. This document defines an FCI
        protocol using the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
        protocol, following the guidelines defined in RFC 8008.

    <section title="Introduction" anchor="intro">
      <t>
        The ability to interconnect multiple content delivery networks (CDNs)
        has many benefits, including increased coverage, capability, and
        reliability. The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI)
        framework <xref target="RFC6707"/> defines four interfaces to
        achieve the interconnection of CDNs: (1) the CDNI Request Routing
        Interface; (2) the CDNI Metadata Interface; (3) the CDNI Logging
        Interface; and (4) the CDNI Control Interface.
      </t>

      <t>
        Among the four interfaces, the CDNI Request Routing Interface
        provides key functions, as specified in <xref target="RFC6707"/>:
        "The CDNI Request Routing interface enables a Request Routing
        function in an Upstream CDN to query a Request Routing function in a
        Downstream CDN to determine if the Downstream CDN is able (and
        willing) to accept the delegated Content Request. It also allows the
        Downstream CDN to control what should be returned to the User Agent
        in the redirection message by the upstream Request Routing function."
        At a high level, the scope of the CDNI Request Routing Interface,
        therefore, contains two main tasks: (1) determining if the dCDN
        (downstream CDN) is willing to accept a delegated content request,
        and (2) redirecting the content request coming from a uCDN (upstream
        CDN) to the proper entry point or entity in the dCDN.
      </t>

      <t>
        Correspondingly, the request routing interface is broadly divided
        into two functionalities: (1) the CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities
        Advertisement interface (FCI) defined in <xref target="RFC8008"/>,
        and (2) the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface (RI) defined
        in <xref target="RFC7975"/>. Since this document focuses on the
        first functionality (CDNI FCI), below is more details about it.
      </t>

      <t>
        Specifically, CDNI FCI allows both an advertisement from a dCDN to a
        uCDN (push) and a query from a uCDN to a dCDN (pull) so that the uCDN
        knows whether it can redirect a particular user request to that dCDN.
      </t>

      <t>
        A key component in defining CDNI FCI is defining objects describing
        the footprints and capabilities of a dCDN. Such objects are already
        defined in <xref target="RFC8008"/>. A protocol to transport and
        update such objects between a uCDN and a dCDN, however, is not
        defined. Hence, the scope of this document is to define such a
        protocol by introducing a new Application-Layer Traffic Optimization
        (ALTO) <xref target="RFC7285"/> service called "CDNI Advertisement Service".
      </t>

      <t>
        There are multiple benefits in using ALTO as a transport protocol, as
        discussed in <xref target="bgALTO"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        The rest of this document is organized as follows. <xref
        target="background"/> provides non-normative background on both CDNI
        FCI and ALTO. <xref target="cdnifci"/> introduces the most basic
        service, called "CDNI Advertisement Service", to realize CDNI FCI using ALTO.
        <xref target="cdnifcinetworkmap"/> demonstrates a key benefit of
        using ALTO: the ability to integrate CDNI FCI with ALTO network maps.
        Such integration provides new granularity to describe footprints.
        <xref target="filteredcdnifci"/> introduces "Filtered CDNI Advertisement
        Service" to allow a uCDN to get footprints with given capabilities
        instead of getting the full resource, which can be large. <xref
        target="unifiedpropertymap"/> further shows another benefit of using
        ALTO: the ability to query footprint properties using ALTO entity
        property map extension. In this way, a uCDN can effectively fetch capabilities of
        footprints in which it is interested. IANA and security
        considerations are discussed in <xref target="iana"/> and <xref
        target="security"/> respectively.
      </t>

    <section title="Background" anchor="background">
      <t>
        The design of CDNI FCI transport using ALTO depends on the
        understanding of both FCI semantics and ALTO. Hence, this document
        starts with a non-normative review for both. The review uses the
        terminologies for CDNI as defined in <xref target="RFC6707"/>, <xref
        target="RFC8006"/> and <xref target="RFC8008"/>; those for ALTO as
        defined in <xref target="RFC7285"/> and <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new"/>.
      </t>

      <section title="Semantics of FCI Advertisement" anchor="bgSemantics">
        <t>
          <xref target="RFC8008"/> (CDNI "Footprint and Capabilities
          Semantics") defines the semantics of CDNI FCI, provides guidance on
          what Footprint and Capabilities mean in a CDNI context, and
          specifies the requirements on the CDNI FCI transport protocol. The
          definitions in <xref target="RFC8008"/> depend on <xref
          target="RFC8006"/>. Below is a non-normative review of key
          related points of <xref target="RFC8008"/> and <xref
          target="RFC8006"/>. For detailed information and normative
          specification, the reader is referred to these two RFCs.

            <t>
              Multiple types of mandatory-to-implement footprints (ipv4cidr,
              ipv6cidr, asn, and countrycode) are defined in <xref
              target="RFC8006"/>. A "Set of IP-prefixes" can contain both
              full IP addresses (i.e., a /32 for IPv4 or a /128 for IPv6) and
              IP prefixes with an arbitrary prefix length. There must also be
              support for multiple IP address versions, i.e., IPv4 and IPv6,
              in such a footprint.
            </t>

            <t>
              Multiple initial types of capabilities are defined in <xref
              target="RFC8008"/> including (1) Delivery Protocol, (2)
              Acquisition Protocol, (3) Redirection Mode, (4) Capabilities
              related to CDNI Logging, and (5) Capabilities related to CDNI
              Metadata. They are required in all cases and therefore
              considered as mandatory-to-implement capabilities for all CDNI
              FCI implementations.
            </t>

            <t>
              Footprint and capabilities are defined together and cannot be
              interpreted independently from each other. Specifically, <xref
              target="RFC8008"/> integrates footprint and capabilities with
              an approach of "capabilities with footprint restrictions", by
              expressing capabilities on a per footprint basis.
            </t>

            <t>
              Specifically, for all mandatory-to-implement footprint types,
              footprints can be viewed as constraints for delegating requests
              to a dCDN: A dCDN footprint advertisement tells the uCDN the
              limitations for delegating a request to the dCDN. For IP
              prefixes or ASN(s), the footprint signals to the uCDN that it
              should consider the dCDN a candidate only if the IP address of
              the request routing source falls within the prefix set (or ASN,
              respectively). The CDNI specifications do not define how a
              given uCDN determines what address ranges are in a particular
              ASN. Similarly, for country codes, a uCDN should only consider
              the dCDN a candidate if it covers the country of the request
              routing source. The CDNI specifications do not define how a
              given uCDN determines the country of the request routing
              source. Multiple footprint constraints are additive, i.e., the
              advertisement of different types of footprint narrows the dCDN
              candidacy cumulatively.
            </t>

            <t>
              Given that a large part of Footprint and Capabilities
              Advertisement may actually happen in contractual agreements,
              the semantics of CDNI Footprint and Capabilities advertisement
              refers to answering the following question: what exactly still
              needs to be advertised by the CDNI FCI? For instance, updates
              about temporal failures of part of a footprint can be useful
              information to convey via the CDNI FCI. Such information would
              provide updates on information previously agreed in contracts
              between the participating CDNs. In other words, the CDNI FCI is
              a means for a dCDN (downstream CDN) to provide changes/updates
              regarding a footprint and/or capabilities that it has prior
              agreed to serve in a contract with a uCDN (upstream CDN).
              Hence, server push and incremental encoding will be necessary
              techniques.

      <section title="ALTO Background and Benefits" anchor="bgALTO">
        <t>
          Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) <xref
          target="RFC7285"/> defines an approach for conveying network layer
          (topology) information to "guide" the resource provider selection
          process in distributed applications that can choose among several
          candidate resources providers to retrieve a given resource.
          Usually, it is assumed that an ALTO server conveys information that
          these applications cannot measure or have difficulty measuring
          themselves <xref target="RFC5693"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          Originally, ALTO was motivated by optimizing cross-ISP traffic
          generated by P2P applications <xref target="RFC5693"/>. However,
          ALTO can also be used for improving the request routing in CDNs. In
          particular, the CDNI problem statement <xref target="RFC6707"/>
          explicitly mentions ALTO as a candidate protocol for "actual
          algorithms for selection of CDN or Surrogate by Request-Routing
          systems".
        </t>

        <t>
          The following reasons make ALTO a suitable candidate protocol for
          dCDN (downstream CDN) selection as part of CDNI request routing
          and, in particular, for an FCI protocol:
        </t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              Application Layer-oriented: ALTO is a protocol specifically designed to improve application
              layer traffic (and application layer connections among hosts on
              the Internet) by providing additional information to
              applications that these applications could not easily retrieve
              themselves. This matches the need of CDNI: a uCDN wants to
              improve application layer CDN request routing by using
              information (provided by a dCDN) that the uCDN could not easily
              obtain otherwise. Hence, ALTO can help a uCDN to select a
              proper dCDN by first providing dCDNs' capabilities as well as
              footprints (see <xref target="cdnifci"/>) and then providing
              costs of surrogates in a dCDN by ALTO cost maps.
            </t>

            <t>
              Security: The identification between uCDNs and dCDNs is an
              important requirement. ALTO maps can be signed and hence
              provide inherent integrity protection. Please see <xref
              target="security"/>.
            </t>

            <t>
              RESTful Design: The ALTO protocol has undergone extensive
              revisions in order to provide a RESTful design regarding the
              client-server interaction specified by the protocol. A CDNI FCI
              interface based on ALTO would inherit this RESTful design.
              Please see <xref target="cdnifci"/>.
            </t>

            <t>
              Error-handling: The ALTO protocol provides extensive
              error-handling in the whole request and response process (see
              Section 8.5 of <xref target="RFC7285"/>). A CDNI FCI interface
              based on ALTO would inherit this this extensive error-handling
              framework. Please see <xref target="filteredcdnifci"/>.
            </t>

            <t>
              Map Service: The semantics of an ALTO network map is an exact match for the
              needed information to convey a footprint by a dCDN, in
              particular, if such a footprint is being expressed by IP-prefix
              ranges. Please see <xref target="cdnifcinetworkmap"/>.
            </t>

            <t>
              Filtered Map Service: The ALTO map filtering service would
              allow a uCDN to query only for parts of an ALTO map. For
              example, the ALTO filtered property map service can enable a
              uCDN to query properties of a part of footprints efficiently
              (see <xref target="unifiedpropertymap"/>).
            </t>

            <t>
              Server-initiated Notifications and Incremental Updates: When
              the footprint or the capabilities of a dCDN change (i.e.,
              unexpectedly from the perspective of a uCDN), server-initiated
              notifications would enable a dCDN to inform a uCDN about such
              changes directly. Consider the case where - due to failure -
              part of the footprint of the dCDN is not functioning, i.e., the
              CDN cannot serve content to such clients with reasonable QoS.
              Without server-initiated notifications, the uCDN might still
              use a recent network and cost map from the dCDN, and therefore
              redirect requests to the dCDN which it cannot serve. Similarly,
              the possibility for incremental updates would enable efficient
              conveyance of the aforementioned (or similar) status changes by

            <t>
              Content Availability on Hosts: A dCDN might want to express CDN
              capabilities in terms of certain content types (e.g., codecs/
              formats, or content from certain content providers). The new
              endpoint property for ALTO would enable a dCDN to make such
              information available to a uCDN. This would enable a uCDN to
              determine whether a dCDN actually has the capabilities for a
              given type of content requested.
            </t>

            <t>
              Resource Availability on Hosts or Links: The capabilities on
              links (e.g., maximum bandwidth) or caches (e.g., average load)
              might be useful information for a uCDN for optimized dCDN
              selection. For instance, if a uCDN receives a streaming request
              for content with a certain bitrate, it needs to know if it is
              likely that a dCDN can fulfill such stringent application-level
              requirements (i.e., can be expected to have enough consistent
              bandwidth) before it redirects the request. In general, if ALTO
              could convey such information via new endpoint properties, it
              would enable more sophisticated means for dCDN selection with
              ALTO. ALTO Path Vector Extension <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-alto-path-vector"/> is designed to allow ALTO
              clients to query information such as capacity regions for a
              given set of flows.

    <section title="CDNI Advertisement Service" anchor="cdnifci">
      <t>
        The ALTO protocol is based on the ALTO Information Service Framework
        which consists of multiple services, where all ALTO services are
        "provided through a common transport protocol, messaging structure
        and encoding, and transaction model" <xref target="RFC7285"/>. The
        ALTO protocol specification <xref target="RFC7285"/> defines multiple
        initial services, e.g., the ALTO network map service and cost map
        service.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document defines a new ALTO service called "CDNI Advertisement Service"
        which conveys JSON objects of media type
        "application/alto-cdni+json". These JSON objects are used to
        transport BaseAdvertisementObject objects defined in <xref
        target="RFC8008"/>; this document specifies how to transport such
        BaseAdvertisementObject objects via the ALTO protocol with the ALTO
        "CDNI Advertisement Service". Similar to other ALTO services, this document
        defines the ALTO information resource for the "CDNI Advertisement Service" as
        follows.
      </t>

      <section title="Media Type" anchor="cdnifcimediatype">
        <t>
          The media type of the CDNI Advertisement resource is

      <section title="Uses" anchor="cdnifciuses">
        <t>
          The "uses" field SHOULD NOT appear unless the CDNI Advertisement resource
          depends on other ALTO information resources. If the CDNI Advertisement
          resource has dependent resources, the resource IDs of its
          dependent resources MUST be included into the "uses" field. This
          document only defines one potential dependent resource for the CDNI
          Advertisement resource. See <xref target="cdnifcinetworkmap"/> for details
          of when and how to use it. Future documents may extend the CDNI Advertisement
          resource and allow other dependent resources.
        </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Response" anchor="cdnifciencoding">
        <t>
          The "meta" field of a CDNI Advertisement response MUST include the "vtag"
          field defined in Section 10.3 of <xref target="RFC7285"/>. This
          field provides the version of the retrieved CDNI FCI resource.
        </t>

        <t>
          If a CDNI Advertisement response depends on other ALTO information resources, it
          MUST include the "dependent-vtags" field, whose value is an array
          to indicate the version tags of the resources used, where each
          resource is specified in "uses" of its IRD entry.
        </t>

        <t>
          The data component of an ALTO CDNI Advertisement response is named
          "cdni-advertisement", which is a JSON object of type CDNIAdvertisementData:
        </t>

        <figure>

            <![CDATA[
    object {
      CDNIAdvertisementData cdni-advertisement;

      BaseAdvertisementObject capabilities-with-footprints<0..*>;
    } CDNIAdvertisementData;
]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          Specifically, a CDNIAdvertisementData object is a JSON object that includes
          only one property named "capabilities-with-footprints", whose value is an array of
          BaseAdvertisementObject objects.
        </t>

        <t>
          The syntax and semantics of BaseAdvertisementObject are well
          defined in Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC8008"/>. A
          BaseAdvertisementObject object includes multiple properties,
          including capability-type, capability-value, and footprints, where
          footprints are defined in Section 4.2.2.2 of <xref
          target="RFC8006"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          To be self-contained, below is a non-normative specification of
          BaseAdvertisementObject. As mentioned above, the normative
          specification of BaseAdvertisementObject is in <xref
          target="RFC8008"/>.
        </t>

        <figure>
          <artwork>
            <![CDATA[
    object {
      JSONString capability-type;
      JSONValue capability-value;
      Footprint footprints<0..*>;
    } BaseAdvertisementObject;

    object {
      JSONString footprint-type;
      JSONString footprint-value<1..*>;
    } Footprint;
]]>
          </artwork>
        </figure>
        <t>
          For each BaseAdvertisementObject, the ALTO client MUST interpret
          footprints appearing multiple times as if they appeared only once.
          If footprints in a BaseAdvertisementObject is null or empty or not
          appearing, the ALTO client MUST understand that the capabilities in
          this BaseAdvertisementObject have the "global" coverage.
        </t>

        <t>
          Note: Further optimization of BaseAdvertisement objects to
          effectively provide the advertisement of capabilities with
          footprint restrictions is certainly possible. For example, these
          two examples below both describe that the dCDN can provide
          capabilities ["http/1.1", "https/1.1"] for the same footprints.
          However, the latter one is smaller in its size.

            Below is the information resource directory (IRD) of a simple,
            example ALTO server. The server provides both base ALTO
            information resources (e.g., network maps) and CDNI FCI related
            information resources (e.g., CDNI Advertisement resources), demonstrating a
            single, integrated environment.

          <t>
            Specifically, the IRD announces two network maps, one CDNI Advertisement
            resource without dependency, one CDNI Advertisement resource depending on a
            network map, one filtered CDNI Advertisement resource to be defined in

            property map including "cdni-capabilities" and "pid" as its
            entity properties, and two update stream services (one for
            updating CDNI Advertisement resources, and the other for updating property
            maps).

            "control-uri" followed by the full CDNI Advertisement response. Then when
            there is a change in the delivery-protocols in that http/1.1 is
            removed (from [http/1.1, https/1.1] to only https/1.1) due to
            maintenance of the https/1.1 clusters, the ALTO server
            regenerates the new CDNI Advertisement resource and pushes the full
            replacement to the ALTO client. Later on, the ALTO server
            notifies the ALTO client that "192.0.2.0/24" is added into the
            "ipv4" footprint object for delivery-protocol https/1.1 by
            sending the change encoded by JSON patch to the ALTO client.

    <section title="CDNI Advertisement Service using ALTO Network Map" anchor="cdnifcinetworkmap">
      <section title="Network Map Footprint Type: altopid">
        <t>
          The ALTO protocol defines a concept called PID to represent a group
          of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses which can be applied the same management
          policy. The PID is an alternative to the pre-defined CDNI footprint
          types (i.e., ipv4cidr, ipv6cidr, asn, and countrycode).
        </t>
        <t>
          To leverage this concept, this document defines a new CDNI
          Footprint Type called "altopid". A CDNI Advertisement resource can
          depend on an ALTO network map resource and use "altopid" footprints
          to compress its CDNI Footprint Payload.
        </t>

        <t>
          Specifically, the "altopid" footprint type indicates that the
          corresponding footprint value is a list of PIDNames as defined in
          <xref target="RFC7285"/>. These PIDNames are references of PIDs
          in a network map resource. Hence a CDNI Advertisement resource using "altopid"
          footprints depends on a network map. For such a CDNI Advertisement resource, the
          resource id of its dependent network map MUST be included in the
          "uses" field of its IRD entry, and the "dependent-vtag" field with
          a reference to this network map MUST be included in its response
          (see the example in <xref target="networkmapfootprint"/>).

        <xref target="cdnifci"/> and <xref target="cdnifcinetworkmap"/>
        describe CDNI Advertisement Service which can be used to enable a uCDN to get
        capabilities with footprint restrictions from dCDNs. However, since
        always getting full CDNI Advertisement resources from dCDNs is inefficient,
        this document introduces a new service named "Filtered CDNI Advertisement
        Service", to allow a client to filter a CDNI Advertisement resource using a
        client-given set of CDNI capabilities. For each entry of the CDNI Advertisement
        response, an entry will only be returned to the client if it contains
        at least one of the client given CDNI capabilities. The relationship
        between a filtered CDNI Advertisement resource and a CDNI Advertisement resource is
        similar to the relationship between a filtered network/cost map and
        a network/cost map.

          target="RFC7285"/>, if the request is invalid.
        </t>

        <t>
          Specifically, a filtered CDNI Advertisement request is invalid if:

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>the value of "capability-type" is null;</t>

          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          When a request is invalid, the ALTO server MUST return an
          "E_INVALID_FIELD_VALUE" error defined in Section 8.5.2 of <xref
          target="RFC7285"/>, and the "value" field of the error message
          SHOULD indicate this CDNI capability.

        <t>
          The ALTO server returns a filtered CDNI Advertisement resource for a valid
          request. The format of a filtered CDNI Advertisement resource is the same as
          a full CDNI Advertisement resource (See <xref target="cdnifciencoding"/>.)
        </t>

        <t>
          The returned CDNI Advertisement resource MUST contain only
          BaseAdvertisementObject objects whose CDNI capability object is the
          superset of one of CDNI capability object in
          "cdni-fci-capabilities". Specifically, that a CDNI capability
          object A is the superset of another CDNI capability object B means
          that these two CDNI capability objects have the same capability
          type and mandatory properties in capability value of A MUST include
          mandatory properties in capability value of B semantically. See
          <xref target="filteredcdnifciexample"/> for a concrete example.
        </t>

        <t>
          The version tag included in the "vtag" field of the response MUST
          correspond to the full CDNI Advertisement resource from which the filtered
          CDNI Advertisement resource is provided. This ensures that a single,
          canonical version tag is used independently of any filtering that
          is requested by an ALTO client.

    <section title="Query Footprint Properties using ALTO Property Map Service" anchor="unifiedpropertymap">
      <t>
        Besides the requirement of retrieving footprints of given
        capabilities, another common requirement for uCDN is to query CDNI
        capabilities of given footprints.
      </t>

      <t>
        Considering each footprint as an entity with properties including
        CDNI capabilities, a natural way to satisfy this requirement is to
        use the ALTO property map as defined in <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new"/>. This section describes
        how ALTO clients look up properties for individual footprints. First,
        it describes how to represent footprint objects as entities in the
        ALTO property map. Then it describes how to represent footprint
        capabilities as entity properties in the ALTO property map. Finally,
        it provides examples of the full property map and the filtered
        property map supporting CDNI capabilities, and their incremental
        updates.
      </t>

      <section title="Representing Footprint Objects as Property Map Entities" anchor="footprinttoentities">
        <t>
          A footprint object has two properties: footprint-type and
          footprint-value. A footprint-value is an array of footprint values
          conforming to the specification associated with the registered
          footprint type ("ipv4cidr", "ipv6cidr", "asn", "countrycode", and "altopid").
          Considering each ALTO entity defined in <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new"/> also has two
          properties: entity domain type and domain-specific identifier, a
          straightforward approach to represent a footprint as an ALTO entity
          is to represent its footprint-type as an entity domain type, and its
          footprint value as a domain-specific identifier.
        </t>

        <t>
          Each existing footprint type can be represented as an entity domain type as follows:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              According to <xref target="I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new"/>,
              "ipv4" and "ipv6" are two predefined entity domain types, which
              can be used to represent "ipv4cidr" and "ipv6cidr" footprints
              respectively.
            </t>
            <t>
              "pid" is also a predefined entity domain type, which can be
              used to represent "altopid" footprints. Note that "pid" is a
              resource-specific entity domain. To represent an "altopid"
              footprint, the specifying information resource of the
              corresponding "pid" entity domain MUST be the dependent network
              map used by the CDNI Advertisement resource providing this "altopid"
              footprint.
            </t>
            <t>
              However, no existing entity domain type can represent "asn" and
              "countrycode" footprints. To represent footprint-type "asn" and
              "countrycode", this document registers two new domains in <xref
              target="iana"/> in addition to the ones in <xref
              target="I-D.ietf-alto-unified-props-new"/>.
            </t>
          </list>
        </t>

        <t>
          Here is an example of representing a footprint object of "ipv4cidr"
          type as a set of "ipv4" entities in the ALTO property map. The
          representation of the footprint object of "ipv6cidr" type is
          similar.

        <t>
          This document defines a new entity property type called "cdni-capabilities".
          An ALTO server can provide a property map resource mapping the
          "cdni-capablities" entity property type for a CDNI Advertisement resource
          that it provides to an "ipv4", "ipv6", "asn" or "countrycode"
          entity domain.

        <section title="Defining Information Resource Media Type for Property Type cdni-capabilities">
          <t>
            The entity property type "cdni-capabilities" allows to define
            resource-specific entity properties. When resource-specific
            entity properties are defined with entity property type
            "cdni-capabilities", the defining information resource for a
            "cdni-capabilities" property MUST be a CDNI Advertisement
            resource provided by the ALTO server. The media type of the
            defining information resource for a "cdni-capabilities" property
            is therefore:

        <section title="Intended Semantics of Property Type cdni-capabilities">
          <t>
            A "cdni-capabilities" property for an entity is to indicate all
            the CDNI capabilities that a corresponding CDNI Advertisement
            resource provides for the footprint represented by this entity.
            Thus, the value of a "cdni-capabilities" property MUST be a JSON array.
            Each element in a "cdni-capabilities" property MUST be an JSON
            object as format of CDNICapability (see <xref
            target="filteredcdnifciinputs"/>). The value of a
            "cdni-capabilities" property for an "ipv4", "ipv6", "asn",
            "countrycode" or "altopid" entity MUST include all the
            CDNICapability objects that are provided by the defining CDNI
            Advertisement resource and the represented footprint object of
            this entity are in their footprint restrictions.

    <section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security">
      <t>
        As an extension of the base ALTO protocol (<xref target="RFC7285"/>),
        this document fits into the architecture of the base protocol. And
        hence Security Considerations of the base protocol (Section 15 of
        <xref target="RFC7285"/>) fully apply when this extension is
        provided by an ALTO server.
      </t>

      <t>
        In the context of CDNI Advertisement, additional security considerations should
        be included as follows:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            For authenticity and integrity of ALTO information, an attacker
            may disguise itself as an ALTO server for a dCDN, and provide
            false capabilities and footprints to a uCDN using the CDNI Advertisement
            service. Such false information may lead a uCDN to (1) select an
            incorrect dCDN to serve user requests, or (2) skip uCDNs in good
            conditions.
          </t>

          <t>
            For potential undesirable guidance from authenticated ALTO
            information, a dCDN can provide a uCDN with limited capabilities
            and smaller footprint coverage so that the dCDN can avoid
            transferring traffic for a uCDN which they should have to
            transfer.
          </t>

          <t>
            For confidentiality and privacy of ALTO information, footprint
            properties integrated with ALTO property maps may expose
            network location identifiers (e.g., IP addresses or fine-grained
            PIDs).
          </t>

          <t>
            For availability of ALTO services, an attacker may conduct
            service degradation attacks using services defined in this
            document to disable ALTO services of a network. It may request
            potentially large, full CDNI Advertisement resources from an ALTO server in
            a dCDN continuously, to consume the bandwidth resources of that
            ALTO server. It may also query filtered property map services
            with many smaller individual footprints, to consume the
            computation resources of the ALTO server.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        Although protection strategies as described in Section 15 of <xref
        target="RFC7285"/> should be applied to address aforementioned
        security considerations, one additional information leakage risk
        introduced by this document could not be addressed by these
        strategies. In particular, if a dCDN signs agreements with multiple
        uCDNs without any isolation, this dCDN may disclose extra information
        of one uCDN to another one. In that case, one uCDN may redirect
        requests which should not have to be served by this dCDN to it.
      </t>

      <t>
        To reduce the risk, a dCDN should isolate full/filtered CDNI Advertisement
        resources for different uCDNs. It could consider generating URIs of
        different full/filtered CDNI Advertisement resources by hashing its company ID,
        a uCDN's company ID as well as their agreements. A dCDN should avoid
        exposing all full/filtered CDNI Advertisement resources in one of its IRDs.
