      <t>Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering
         to deploy Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their
         networks. As a consequence of this development, there is a

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>Many Network Service Providers (NSPs) are currently considering or have already started to deploy Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) within their networks. As a consequence of this development, there is a need for interconnecting these local CDNs. Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) has the goal of standardizing protocols to enable such interconnection of CDNs <xref target="RFC6707" pageno="false" format="default"/>.</t>
         
      <t>The CDNI problem statement <xref target="RFC6707" pageno="false" format="default"/> envisions four interfaces to be standardized within the IETF for CDN interconnection: 
        <list style="symbols">
               <t>CDNI Request Routing Interface</t>
               <t>CDNI Metadata Interface</t>
               <t>CDNI Logging Interface</t>
               <t>CDNI Control Interface</t>
        </list></t>
        
      <t>This document focuses solely on the CDNI Request Routing Interface, which can be further divided into two interfaces (see <xref target="RFC6707" pageno="false" format="default"/> for a detailed description): the CDNI Request Routing Redirection interface (RI), and the CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI). This document specifies a new Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) <xref target="RFC7285" pageno="false" format="default"/> service called 'CDNI Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement Service'. This service is used to transport CDNI FCI JSON objects, which are defined in a separate document in <xref target="RFC8008"/>.</t>
                       
      <t>Throughout this document, we use the terminology for CDNI defined in <xref target="RFC6707" pageno="false" format="default"/>.      
        </t>        
    </section> 

    <section anchor="requestrouting" title="ALTO within CDNI Request Routing">
      <t>The main purpose of the CDNI Request Routing Interface is described in <xref target="RFC6707" pageno="false" format="default"/> as follows: "The CDNI Request Routing interface enables a Request Routing function in an Upstream CDN to query a Request Routing function in a Downstream CDN to determine if the Downstream CDN is able (and willing) to accept the delegated Content Request.  It also allows the Downstream CDN to control what should be returned to the User Agent in the redirection message by the upstream Request Routing function." On a high level, the scope of the CDNI Request Routing Interface therefore contains two main tasks:
      <list style="symbols">
               <t>A) Determining if the downstream CDN is willing to accept a delegated content request</t>
               <t>B) Redirecting the content request coming from an upstream CDN to the proper entry point or entity in the downstream CDN</t>
      </list>
      </t>
         
      <t>More precisely, in <xref target="RFC7336" pageno="false" format="default"/> the request routing interface is broadly divided into two functionalities:
      <list style="symbols">
               <t>1) the asynchronous advertisement of footprint and capabilities by a dCDN that allows a uCDN to decide whether to redirect particular user requests to that dCDN (the CDNI FCI)</t>
               <t>2) the synchronous operation of actually redirecting a user request (the CDNI RI)</t>
      </list>		
      </t>
         
      <t>Application Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) <xref target="RFC7285" pageno="false" format="default"/> is an approach for guiding the resource provider selection process in distributed applications that can choose among several candidate resources providers to retrieve a given resource. By conveying network layer (topology) information, an ALTO server can provide important information to "guide" the resource provider selection process in distributed applications. Usually, it is assumed that an ALTO server conveys information these applications cannot measure themselves <xref target="RFC5693" pageno="false" format="default"/>. 
      </t>
         
      <t>
         Originally, ALTO was motivated by the huge amount of cross-ISP traffic generated by P2P applications <xref target="RFC5693" pageno="false" format="default"/>. Recently, however, ALTO is also being considered for improving the request routing in CDNs <xref target="I-D.jenkins-alto-cdn-use-cases"/>. In this context, it has also been proposed to use ALTO for selecting an entry-point in a downstream NSP's network (see section 3.4 "CDN delivering Over-The-Top of a NSP's network" in <xref target="I-D.jenkins-alto-cdn-use-cases"/>). Also, the CDNI problem statement explicitly mentions ALTO as a candidate protocol for "algorithms for selection of CDN or Surrogate by Request-Routing systems" <xref target="RFC6707" pageno="false" format="default"/>.     
       </t>

        <t>Why ALTO cannot be the request routing protocol itself ...

    </section> 
      
      
    <section anchor="designcons" title="Assumptions and High-Level Design Considerations">
      <t>In this section we list some assumptions and design issues to be considered when using ALTO for the CDNI Footprint and Capabilities Advertisement interface.</t>
         
      <section anchor="general" title="General Assumptions and Considerations">
        
        <t>Below we list some general assumptions and considerations:
         
        <list style="symbols">                        
          <t>As explicitly being out-of-scope for CDNI <xref target="RFC6707" pageno="false" format="default"/>, it is assumed that ingestion of content or acquiring content across CDNs is not part of request routing as considered within CDNI standardization work. The focus of using ALTO (as considered in this document) is hence on request routing only, assuming that the content (desired by the end user) is available in the downstream CDN (or can be aquired by the downstream CDN by some means).
          </t>
                            
          <t>Federation Model: "Footprint and Capabilities Advertisement" and in general CDN request routing depends on the federation model among the CDN providers. Designing a suitable solution thus depends on whether a solution is needed for different settings, where CDNs consist of both NSP CDNs (serving individual ASes) and general, traditional CDNs (such as Akamai). We assume that CDNI is not designed for a setting where only NSP CDNs each serve a single AS only.</t>
                                             
          <t>In this document, it is assumed that the upstream CDN (uCDN) makes the decision on selecting a downstream CDN, based on information that each downstream CDN has made available to the upstream CDN. Further, we assume that in principle more than one dCDN may be suitable for a given end-user request (i.e. different dCDNs may claim "overlapping" footprints). The uCDN hence potentially has to select among several candidate downstream CDNs for a given end user request.
          </t>
               
          <t>It is not clear what kind(s) of business, contract, and operational relationships two peering CDNs may form. For the Internet, we see provider-customer and peering as two main relations; providers may use different charging models (e.g., 95-percentile, total volume) and may provide different SLAs. Given such unknown characteristics of CDN peering business agreements, we should design the protocol to support as much diverse potential business and operational models as possible.</t>

      </section>
                  
		  <section anchor="guidance" title="Semantics for Footprint/Capabilities Advertisment"> 

         <t>The CDNI document on "Footprint and Capabilities Semantics" <xref target="RFC8008"/> defines the semantics for the CDNI FCI. It thus provides guidance on what Footprint and Capabilities mean in a CDNI context and how a protocol solution should in principle look like. Here we briefly summarize the key points of the semantics of Footprint and Capabilities (for a detailed discussion, the reader is referred to <xref target="RFC8008"/>):
         
         <list style="symbols">
                        
         <t>Often, footprint and capabilities are tied together and cannot be
      interpreted independently from each other. In such cases, i.e. where
      capabilities must be expressed on a per footprint basis, it may be
      beneficial to combine footprint and capabilities advertisement.</t>


         
               <t>Given that a large part of Footprint and Capabilities Advertisement will actually
      happen in contractual agreements, the semantics of CDNI Footprint and Capabilities
      advertisement refer to answering the following question: what exactly
      still needs to be advertised by the CDNI FCI? For instance, updates
      about temporal failures of part of a footprint can be useful information
      to convey via the CDNI request routing interface. Such information would
      provide updates on information previously agreed in contracts between
      the participating CDNs. In other words, the CDNI FCI is a means for a
      dCDN to provide changes/updates regarding a footprint and/or capabilities it has prior
      agreed to serve in a contract with a uCDN.</t>
      
      
            <t>It seems clear that "coverage/reachability" types of footprint must be supported within CDNI. The following such types of footprint are mandatory and must be supported by the CDNI FCI:
      	<list style="symbols">
          <t>List of ISO Country Codes</t>
          <t>List of AS numbers</t>
          <t>Set of IP-prefixes</t>
        </list> 
      
      A 'set of IP-prefixes' must be able to contain full IP addresses, i.e., a /32 for IPv4 and a /128 for IPv6, and also IP prefixes with an arbitrary prefix length. There must also be support for multiple IP address versions, i.e., IPv4 and IPv6, in such a footprint.
      
      </t>
      
      
            <t>
      For all of these mandatory-to-implement footprint types, footprints can be viewed as constraints for delegating requests to a dCDN: A dCDN footprint advertisement tells the uCDN the limitations for delegating a request to the dCDN. For IP prefixes or ASN(s), the footprint signals to the uCDN that it should consider the dCDN a candidate only if the IP address of the request routing source falls within the prefix set (or ASN, respectively). The CDNI specifications do not define how a given uCDN determines what address ranges are in a particular ASN. Similarly, for country codes a uCDN should only consider the dCDN a candidate if it covers the country of the request routing source. The CDNI specifications do not define how a given uCDN determines the country of the request routing source. Multiple footprint constraints are additive, i.e. the advertisement of different types of footprint narrows the dCDN candidacy cumulatively.
		</t>
      
      
      <t>The following capabilities seem
      useful as 'base' capabilities, i.e. ones that are needed in any case and
      therefore constitute mandatory capabilities to be supported by the CDNI
      FCI: <list style="symbols">
          <t>Delivery Protocol (e.g., HTTP vs. RTMP)</t>
          
          <t>Acquisition Protocol (for aquiring content from a uCDN)</t>

          <t>Redirection Mode (e.g., DNS Redirection vs. HTTP Redirection as
          discussed in <xref target="RFC7336" pageno="false" format="default"/>)</t>

          <t>Capabilities related to CDNI Logging (e.g., supported logging
          mechanisms)</t>

          <t>Capabilities related to CDNI Metadata (e.g., authorization
          algorithms or support for proprietary vendor metadata)</t>

      	         <section anchor="altoselectionadvantages" title="Advantages of using ALTO as the CDNI FCI protocol">
         <t>The following reasons make ALTO a suitable candidate protocol for downstream CDN selection as part of CDNI request routing and in particular for an FCI protocol:         <list style="symbols">
         	           	   <t>CDN request routing is done at the application layer. ALTO is a protocol specifically designed to improve application layer traffic (and application layer connections among hosts on the Internet) by providing additonal information to applications that these applications could not easily retrieve themselves. For CDNI, this is exactly the case: a uCDN wants to improve application layer CDN request routing by using dedicated information (provided by a dCDN) that the uCDN could not easily obtain otherwise.</t>
         	           	   
         	           	                  <t>The semantics of an ALTO network map are an exact match for the needed information to convey a footprint by a downstream CDN, in particular if such a footprint is being expressed by IP-prefix ranges.</t>         	           	                          
         	           	   
         	   <t>Security: ALTO maps can be signed and hence provide inherent integrity protection (see <xref target="security"/>)</t>
         	  
         	   <t>RESTful-Design: The ALTO protocol has undergone extensive revisions in order to provide a RESTful design regarding the client-server interaction specified by the protocol. A CDNI FCI interface based on ALTO would inherit this RESTful design.</t>
         	   
         	   <t>Error-handling: The ALTO protocol has undergone extensive revisions in order to provide sophisticated error-handling, inparticular regarding unexpected cases. A CDNI FCI interface based on ALTO would inherit this thought-through and mature error-handling.</t>
         	   
		
			     <t>Filtered network map: The ALTO Map Filtering Service (see <xref target="RFC7285" pageno="false" format="default"/> for details) would allow a uCDN to query only for parts of an ALTO map.

         Under the considerations stated in <xref target="designcons"/>, ALTO can help the upstream CDN provider to select a proper downstream CDN provider for a given end user request as follows: Each downstream CDN provider hosts an ALTO server which provides ALTO services which convey CDNI FCI information to an ALTO client at the upstream CDN provider.

         It is envisioned that yet-to-be-defined ALTO extensions will be standardized that make the ALTO protocol more suitable and useful for applications other than the originally considered P2P use case <xref target="I-D.marocco-alto-next"/>. Some of these extensions to the ALTO protocol would be useful for ALTO to be used as a protocol within CDNI request routing, and in particular within the "Footprint and Capabilities Advertisment" part of the CDNI request routing interface.</t>
         
         <t>
         The following proposed extensions to ALTO would be beneficial to facilitate CDNI request routing with ALTO as outlined in <xref target="altoCDNselection"/>:
         <list style="symbols">
               <t>Server-initiated Notifications and Incremental Updates: In case the footprint or the capabilities of a downstream CDN change abruptly (i.e. unexpectedly from the perspective of an upstream CDN), server initiated notifications would enable a dCDN to directly inform an upstream CDN about such changes. Consider the case where - due to failure - part of the footprint of the dCDN is not functioning, i.e. the CDN cannot serve content to such clients with reasonable QoS. Without server-initiated notifications, the uCDN might still use a very recent network and cost map from dCDN, and therefore redirect request to dCDN which it cannot serve. Similarly, the possibility for incremental updates would enable efficient conveyance of the aforementioned (or similar) status changes by the dCDN to the uCDN. A proposal for server-initiated ALTO updates can be found in <xref target="I-D.marocco-alto-ws"/>. A discussion of incremental ALTO updates can be found in <xref target="I-D.schwan-alto-incr-updates"/>. </t>
               <t>Content Availability on Hosts: A dCDN might want to express CDN capabilties in terms of certain content types (e.g. codecs/formats, or content from certain content providers). A new endpoint property for ALTO that would be able to express such "content availability" would enable a dCDN to make available such information to an upstream CDN. This would enable a uCDN to determine if a given dCDN actually has the capabilities for a given request with respect to the type of content requested.</t>
               <t>Resource Availability on Hosts or Links: The capabilities on links (e.g. maximum bandwidth) or caches (e.g. average load) might be useful information for an upstream CDN for optimized dowmstream CDN selection. For instance, if a uCDN receives a streaming request for content with a certain bitrate, it needs to know if it is likely that a dCDN can fulfill such stringent application-level requirements (i.e. can be expected to have enough consistent bandwidth) before it redirects the request. In general, if ALTO could convey such information via new endpoint properties, it would enable more sophisticated means for downstream CDN selection with ALTO.</t>

      <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
         <t>One important security consideration is the proper authentication of advertisement information provided by a downstream CDN. The ALTO protocol provides a specification for a signature of ALTO information (see 8.2.2. of <xref target="RFC7285" pageno="false" format="default"/>. ALTO thus provides a proper means for protecting the integrity of FCI information.</t>
         
         <t>More Security Considerations will be discussed in a future version of this document.</t>
