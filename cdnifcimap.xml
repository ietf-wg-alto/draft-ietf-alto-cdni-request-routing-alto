    	<t>
          The ALTO protocol is based on an ALTO Information Service Framework which consists of several services, where all ALTO services are "provided through a common transport protocol, messaging structure and encoding, and transaction model" <xref target="RFC7285" pageno="false" format="default"/>. The ALTO protocol specification <xref target="RFC7285" pageno="false" format="default"/> defines several such services, e.g., the ALTO map service.
      </t>

      <t>
          This document defines a new ALTO Service called "CDNI FCI Service" which conveys JSON objects of media type "application/alto-cdnifci+json". These JSON objects are used to transport BaseAdvertisementObject objects defined in <xref target="RFC8008"/>; this document specifies how to transport such BaseAdvertisementObject objects via the ALTO protocol with the ALTO "CDNI FCI Service". Similar to other ALTO services, this document defines the ALTO information resource for the "CDNI FCI Service" as follows.

    		  The "uses" field SHOULD NOT appear unless the CDNI FCI resource depends on some ALTO information resources. If the CDNI FCI resource has some dependent resources, the resource IDs of its dependent resources MUST be included into the "uses" field. This document only defines one potential dependent resource for the CDNI FCI resource. See <xref target="cdnifcinetworkmap"/> for details of when and how to use it. The future documents may extend the CDNI FCI resource and allow other dependent resources.

    	<section title="Response" anchor="cdnifcimapencoding">
    		<t>
    			The "meta" field of a CDNI FCI response MUST include the "vtag" field defined in Section 10.3 of <xref target="RFC7285" pageno="false" format="default"/>. This field provides the version of the retrieved CDNI FCI map.</t>

        <t>
          If a CDNI FCI response depends on an ALTO information resource, it MUST include the "dependent-vtags" field, whose value is an array to indicate the version tags of the resources used, where each resource is specified in "uses" of its IRD entry.
        </t>
        <t>
    			The data component of an ALTO CDNI FCI response is named "cdni-fci", which is a JSON object of type CDNIFCIData:

    object {
        CDNIFCIData cdni-fci-map;
    } InfoResourceCDNIFCI : ResponseEntityBase;

    object {
        BaseAdvertisementObject capabilities<1..*>;

        </figure>
            <t>
              Specifically, a CDNIFCIData object is a JSON object that includes only one property named "capabilities", whose value is an array of BaseAdvertisementObject objects.
            </t>

            <t>
              The syntax and semantics of BaseAdvertisementObject are well defined in Section 5.1 of <xref target="RFC8008" pageno="false" format="default"/>. A BaseAdvertisementObject object includes multiple properties, including capability-type, capability-value and footprints, where footprints are defined in Section 4.2.2.2 of <xref target="RFC8006" pageno="false" format="default"/>.
            </t>

            <t>
              To be self-contained, we give a non-normative specification of BaseAdvertisementObject below. As mentioned above, the normative specification of BaseAdvertisementObject is in <xref target="RFC8008" pageno="false" format="default"/>
            </t>
        <figure align="left">
              <artwork align="left"><![CDATA[
    object {
        JSONString capability-type;
        JSONValue capability-value;
        Footprint footprints<0..*>;
    } BaseAdvertisementObject;

    object {
        JSONString footprint-type;
        JSONString footprint-value<1..*>;
    } Footprint;
                ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
            <t>
                For each BaseAdvertisementObject, the ALTO client MUST interpret footprints appearing multiple times as if they appeared only once. If footprints in a BaseAdvertisementObject is null or empty or not appearing, the ALTO client MUST understand that the capabilities in this BaseAdvertisementObject have the "global" coverage.
            </t>
            <t>
                Note: Further optimization of BaseAdvertisement objects to effectively provide the advertisement of capabilities with footprint restrictions is certainly possible. For example, these two examples below both describe that the dCDN can provide capabilities ["http/1.1", "https/1.1"] for the same footprints. However, the latter one is smaller in its size.

    				A benefit of using ALTO to provide CDNI FCI maps is that such maps can be updated using ALTO incremental updates. Below is an example that also shows the benefit of having both JSON merge patch and JSON patch to encode updates.
          </t>
          <t>
          At first, an ALTO client requests updates for "my-default-cdnifci", and the ALTO server returns the "control-uri" followed by the full CDNI FCI response. Then when there is a change in the delivery-protocols in that `http/2` is removed (from http/1.1 and http/2 to only http/1.1) due to maintenance of the http/2 clusters, the ALTO server uses JSON merge patch to encode the change and pushes the change to the ALTO client. Later on, the ALTO server notifies the ALTO client that "ipv4:192.0.2.0/24" is added into the footprint for delivery-protocol http/1.1 by sending the change encoded by JSON patch to the ALTO client.
