capabilities with footprint restrictions

the CDNI FCI is a means for a dCDN to provide changes/updates
   regarding a footprint it has previously agreed to serve in a contract
   with a uCDN.

 A Footprint object describes the footprint to which a LocationRule
   can be applied, e.g., an IPv4 address range or a geographic location.

      Property: footprint-type

         Description: Registered footprint type (see Section 7.2).  The
         footprint types specified by this document are "ipv4cidr"
         (IPv4CIDR; see Section 4.3.5), "ipv6cidr" (IPv6CIDR; see
         Section 4.3.6), "asn" (Autonomous System Number; see
         Section 4.3.7), and "countrycode" (Country Code; see
         Section 4.3.8).

         Type: Lowercase string

         Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes.

      Property: footprint-value

         Description: Array of footprint values conforming to the
         specification associated with the registered footprint type.
         Footprint values can be simple strings (e.g., IPv4CIDR,
         IPv6CIDR, ASN, and Country Code); however, other Footprint
         objects can be defined in the future, along with a more complex
         encoding (e.g., GPS coordinate tuples).

         Type: Array of footprints

         Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes.

   Example Footprint object describing a footprint covering the USA:

   {
     "footprint-type": "countrycode",
     "footprint-value": ["us"]
   }

   Example Footprint object describing a footprint covering the IP
   address ranges 192.0.2.0/24 and 198.51.100.0/24:

   {
     "footprint-type": "ipv4cidr",
     "footprint-value": ["192.0.2.0/24", "198.51.100.0/24"]
   }

   Example Footprint object describing a footprint covering the IP
   address ranges 2001:db8::/32:

   {
     "footprint-type": "ipv6cidr",
     "footprint-value": ["2001:db8::/32"]
   }

   Example Footprint object describing a footprint covering the
   autonomous system 64496:

   {
     "footprint-type": "asn",
     "footprint-value": ["as64496"]
   }
