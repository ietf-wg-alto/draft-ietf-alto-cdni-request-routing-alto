The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) framework
defines a set of protocols to interconnect CDNs, to achieve multiple
goals such as extending the reach of a given CDN to areas that are
not covered by that particular CDN. One component that is needed to
achieve the goal of CDNI described in CDNI framework is the CDNI
Request Routing Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface
(FCI). RFC 8008 defines precisely the semantics of FCI and provides
guidelines on the FCI protocol, but the exact protocol is explicitly
outside the scope of that document. This document defines an FCI
protocol using the Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO)
protocol, following the guidelines defined in RFC 8008.
