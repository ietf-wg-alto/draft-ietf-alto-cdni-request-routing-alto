The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) framework in RFC 6707
defines a set of protocols to interconnect CDNs to achieve multiple goals,
including extending the reach of a given CDN. A CDNI Request Routing Footprint
&amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) is needed to achieve the goals
of a CDNI. RFC 8008 defines precisely the semantics of FCI and provides
guidelines on the FCI protocol, but the exact protocol is specified. This
document specifies a FCI protocol as an extension to the Application-Layer
Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol, and it follows the guidelines in RFC
8008. 

<!--
The Content Delivery Networks Interconnection (CDNI) framework
defines a set of protocols to interconnect CDNs, to achieve multiple
goals such as extending the reach of a given CDN to areas that are
not covered by that particular CDN. One component that is needed to
achieve the goal of CDNI described in CDNI framework is the CDNI
Request Routing Footprint &amp; Capabilities Advertisement interface
(FCI). RFC 8008 defines precisely the semantics of FCI and provides
guidelines on the FCI protocol, but the exact protocol is explicitly
outside the scope of that document. This document defines a new
Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) service called "CDNI
Advertisement Service" that provides an implementation of the FCI, following
the guidelines defined in RFC 8008.
